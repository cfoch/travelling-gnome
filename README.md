travelling-gnome
================

Web application for the GNOME Travel Committee.

The goal of this application is to remove the slow and extremely time
consuming process of using email to process applications.

This means that the application should receive applications with a web
form, allow these applications to be sorted, processed, searched.

The big list of things to do is as follows:
* Finish polishing the models and their fields.
* Create a public UI for sponsorship requests
* Decide on the logic for privacy of applications (probably
  email tokens that are valid just for an hour or so)
* Add private/public comments model and UI

There are no plans for a "public" admin interface. Travel committee
members will just use the django admin interface.

It is still early to openly ask for help, but if you are interested in
this project, feel free to check the code and point bugs, suggestions.

An interesting thing to contribute, and somewhat independent of the
current state, are mockups of the sponsorship request form.
It should be simple, very clear, and inviting.

Refer to https://live.gnome.org/Travel to get an idea of what we need.

Hopefully this will in place before GUADEC 2013.
